Build a website that performs the functionalities of splitwise app
Certainly! Here’s a structured approach for developing a web application like Splitwise, outlining the steps from initial planning to implementation:
1. Technical Specification Document (Tech Spec)
	• Purpose: Define the overall goals, features, and architecture of your application.
	• Contents:
		○ Overview: Brief description of the application and its purpose.
		○ Features: List of core features (e.g., user registration, expense tracking, bill splitting).
		○ User Stories: Describe how different types of users will interact with the application (e.g., “As a user, I want to add an expense so that I can track my spending”).
		○ Technical Requirements: Specify the technologies to be used (e.g., frontend frameworks, backend frameworks, database, hosting).
		○ Architecture: High-level architecture diagram showing the interaction between frontend, backend, and database.
2. Design the API Contracts
	• Purpose: Create a clear contract for how the frontend and backend will communicate.
	• Tools: Use OpenAPI (Swagger) or Postman for documentation.
	• Contents:
		○ Endpoints: List of all API endpoints with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
		○ Request/Response Formats: Define the expected request body and response structure for each endpoint (including status codes).
		○ Authentication: Specify how users will authenticate (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
		○ Error Handling: Define standard error responses for invalid requests or server errors.
3. Database Design
	• Purpose: Model the data that your application will use.
	• Contents:
		○ Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Create an ERD to visualize the relationships between different data entities (e.g., Users, Expenses, Groups).
		○ Data Models: Define the schema for each entity, including fields and types.
4. Implement the Backend
	• Purpose: Develop the backend services based on the defined API contracts.
	• Steps:
		○ Set Up Development Environment: Choose your backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django, Spring Boot) and set up the environment.
		○ Create API Endpoints: Implement each endpoint defined in the API contracts, ensuring to handle data validation, business logic, and database interactions.
		○ Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests for the API endpoints to ensure they work correctly.
		○ Documentation: Keep your API documentation updated as you implement the endpoints.
5. Develop the Frontend
	• Purpose: Build the user interface that interacts with the backend.
	• Steps:
		○ Choose a Frontend Framework: Select a framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
		○ UI Design: Create wireframes or mockups of the user interface based on user stories.
		○ Implement Features: Develop the frontend by consuming the backend APIs. Use tools like Axios or Fetch for API calls.
		○ State Management: Manage application state effectively (consider using Redux for React).
		○ Testing: Write tests for frontend components to ensure they function correctly.
6. Integration Testing
	• Purpose: Ensure that the frontend and backend work seamlessly together.
	• Steps:
		○ Manual Testing: Test the application manually to ensure all features work as expected.
		○ Automated Tests: Write end-to-end tests to cover user flows.
7. Deployment
	• Purpose: Deploy the application to a production environment.
	• Steps:
		○ Choose Hosting: Select a hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
		○ Set Up CI/CD: Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment to automate testing and deployment.
		○ Monitoring: Set up monitoring and logging to keep track of application performance and errors.
8. Iterate and Improve
	• User Feedback: Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
	• New Features: Plan and implement additional features based on user needs and business goals.
	• Maintain Documentation: Keep all documentation updated for future reference.
Conclusion
This structured approach ensures a clear workflow from planning through to deployment. By focusing on technical specifications, API contracts, and iterative development, you can create a robust web application while accommodating changes and improvements along the way.
